title: 'Wrangling with Restaurant Reviews'
---

What I most value in a restaurant is the quality and flavor of the food. I admit, prompt friendly service and a nice atmosphere, adds to a restaurant's appeal, but they are really count for bonus points. I have friends who don't share the same values, and appreciate more of a helpful smile and original decor. My motivations for the project was to examine the values of Toronto restaurant diners by identifying the latent topics underlying positive and negative restaurant reviews and clustering the reviews based on their topics. There were over 24,500 reviews for over 6000 Toronto restaurants in (Yelp's data set)[https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge].

All the code for this project is available in (this github repo)[https://github.com/ailchau/Metis_Projects/tree/master/wrangling_with_restaurant_reviews].
