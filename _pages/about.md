As a former cognitive neuroscience researcher, I have over 7 years of experience in experimental design, hypothesis testing, data preparation, and data analysis. I enjoy thinking creatively about how to solve problems and extract meaning from data.

I have recently completed the Metis data science bootcamp and I am excited to leverage my past experiences and skills in this new field. The purpose of this blog is to highlight my data science projects, and some of the interesting things I have learned while exploring the field of machine learning and data science.
