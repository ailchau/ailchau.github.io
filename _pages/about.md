I am drawn to problems that involve creative and analytical thinking. Particularly, I am interested in using data to extract insights and tell stories. I recently finished the [Metis](www.thisismetis.com) data science bootcamp and my data science practice is growing. I will be posting my data science projects and highlighting interesting things I learn along the way.

My background is in cognitive neuroscience and psychology. I have over 7 years of experience in experimental design, hypothesis testing, data munging, and data analysis to derive insights about human thought and behavior ([my publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CkX8wNoAAAAJ&hl=en)). I am also experienced at communicating complex analyses and findings through storytelling and visualizations.

During my free time, you can find me exploring art exhibitions, trying out teas, and experimenting with recipes. I am a fan of long-form journalism and my adopted city of Chicago.
